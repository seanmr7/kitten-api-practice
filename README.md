# README

A very basic application to learn the basics for sending RESTful responses in JSON format. The first portion of this project was to create a kitten model, controller and views. This could have easily been done using a Rails scaffold, however doing everything without scaffolding was good review. The second part was to then add JSON responses to the index and show methods in the controller.
